# 1. Introduction to Big Data
* Big data is a term used to refer to the study and applications of data sets that are too complex for traditional data-processing software
* There are three Vs of Big data that are used to describe its characteristics:
  * Volume refers to the size of data
  * Variety refers to different sources and formats of data
  * Velocity is the speed at which data is generated and available for processing

### 1.1 Big Data Concepts and Terminology
* Clustered computing is the pooling of resources of multiple machines to complete jobs
* Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously
* A distributed computing involves nodes or networked computers that run jobs in parallel
* Batch processing refers to the breaking data into smaller pieces and running each piece on an individual machine
* Real-time processing demands that information is processed and made ready immediately
